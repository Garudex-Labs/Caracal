## Overview

**Caracal** is a pre-execution authority enforcement system for AI agents and automated software operating in production environments. It exists at the boundary where autonomous decisions turn into irreversible actions—API calls, database writes, or system triggers.

By enforcing the **principle of explicit authority**, Caracal ensures no action executes without a cryptographically verified, time-bound mandate issued under a governing policy.

---

## Core Interfaces

### 1. Caracal SDK (Python & Node.js)

**Target:** Developers and System Architects.

The second-generation (v2) SDK provides a unified, high-performance interface for integrating Caracal into any agentic loop.

**Installation (Python):**

```bash
pip install caracal-core
```

**Installation (Node.js):**

```bash
npm install @caracal/core
```

**Fluent API Example:**

```python
from caracal.sdk import CaracalClient

client = CaracalClient(api_key="your-key")
context = client.context.checkout(workspace_id="ws_123")

# Register an agent principal
agent = context.agents.create(name="web-scraper", owner="system")
```

### 2. Caracal Flow (TUI)

**Target:** Security Operations and Governance Officers.

Interactive terminal interface for monitoring authority ledgers, managing principals, and initial onboarding.

```bash
caracal-flow
```

## Technical Architecture

Caracal Core (the open-source foundation) implements the primary enforcement engine:

| Component      | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Principals** | Identities (agents/users) with ECDSA P-256 cryptographic keys.      |
| **Policies**   | Fine-grained rules defining resource patterns and allowed actions.  |
| **Mandates**   | Short-lived, signed tokens granting the right to execute an action. |
| **Ledger**     | High-performance audit trail of every authorization event.          |

> [!NOTE]
> Enterprise features (Gateway Proxy, SSO Provider, Compliance Extensions) have been moved to the proprietary **caracalEnterprise** repository.
